Here are just some notes that may need to be taken into consideration when programming here:

* Some gems may not be able to be installed with bundler due to errors. Try using "gem install" with them
    - importmap-rails
    - turbo-rails
    - nokogiri
    - erb

* Also, try running "bundle update" before doing "bundle install"
